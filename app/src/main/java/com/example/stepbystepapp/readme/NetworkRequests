Network Requests
@author Marshall Ladd

Network requests are a very important part of Android development.  It allows us to store information in a
remote location, to be accessed later through an endpoint.  This reduces the size of apps, and keeps the information
inside of them current

For this project, we will be using a library known as RetroFit2.  RetroFit2 handles asynchronous network requests
and removes the need for us to write a lot of code.

Asynchronous call are calls that happen in the background.  If you remember, we discussed how the code we have been
writing so far has all run on the main(UI) thread.  If a network request were to happen on the main thread,
the app would appear to freeze, as it is waiting for the download/request to finish.  This is not what we want.
Thankfully, we don't need to think about it that much, as RetroFit will be handling that for us.

RetroFit will also generate code for us, using annotations.  Annotations are lines of code marked with the '@'
symbol.  We create an interface with functions that contain no bodies, but are marked with various annotation.  At
compile time, RetroFit will generate code for you, based on the annotation and the function signature.
