RecyclerView Pattern
@author Marshall Ladd

RecyclerView is an advanced ListView that is more memory efficient, and provide convenient
helper methods that a standard ListView does not have.

The RecyclerView requires 4 pieces, working together to display data to the screen in a list.
- A List of data
- A ListAdapter
- A ViewHolder
- An XML layout

The ListAdapter is responsible for linking an XML file to a ViewHolder (this is called inflating).
This happens in the overridden onCreateViewHolder function.  The ListAdapter then connects, or
binds an Object from the list of data to the newly created ViewHolder, which can then be added
to the RecyclerView and shown on the screen.
