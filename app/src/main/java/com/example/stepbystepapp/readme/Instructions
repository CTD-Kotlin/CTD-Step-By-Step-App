This project is intended to give you a script on how to build a simple app.
@author Marshall Ladd

NOTE: This is not the only way to build an app.  This is one of infinite possibilities.

The app will connect to a remote API, download some data from the API, then display the data
in a RecyclerView.

Comments are labeled according to which step in this file they occur in.  Example: Navigation
comments will all be labeled '04' as it matches the step that it is started in, in this file.

00. Create a new project.

01. If you know the dependencies your project will use, add them now to the App level gradle
    file (Module: app).
    -Sync with gradle after completing this step.
    -This can and will likely be done at other times in future projects as well. It's just a
        good idea to plan ahead when you can.

02. Add the Fragments to the project.
    -Where your Kotlin files are located, right click on the package
    -Select new > Fragment > blank
    -Name your fragment and uncheck 'include factory methods' and uncheck 'interface callbacks'
    -This will create your fragment class, the associated layout(XML) file, and connect the two
    -This can be done at any time in your project, and is the same procedure for all Fragments

03. Update the generated XML files for each Fragment(design your layout).
    -This is a good time to also make the XML layout file that will be used as
        a ViewHolder in the RecyclerView.  In this example, the view_holder_employee.xml
        layout is that view.

04. Set up your apps navigation.
    -
    -see NavInstructions.txt for more information about how everything is linked together

--- Run your app.  It should load the first fragment into view, but it will not do anything yet.
--- DO NOT MOVE FORWARD UNTIL ALL PRIOR STEPS ARE COMPLETED AND THE APP RUNS

05. Create your data classes.
    -If you are downloading from an API, ensure your data classes match your JSON.

06. Create your RecyclerView Adapter, ViewHolder, and DiffUtil
    -see RecyclerView.txt
