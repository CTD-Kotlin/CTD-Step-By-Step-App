This project is intended to give you a script on how to build a simple app.

The app will connect to a remote API, download some data from the API, then display the data
in a RecyclerView.

01. Create a new project.

02. If you know the dependencies your project will use, add them now to the App level gradle
    file (Module: app).
    -Sync with gradle after completing this step.
    -This can and will likely be done at other times in future projects as well. It's just a
        good idea to plan ahead when you can.

03. Add the Fragments to the project.
    -Where your Kotlin files are located, right click on the package
    -Select new > Fragment > blank
    -Name your fragment and uncheck 'include factory methods' and uncheck 'interface callbacks'
    -This will create your fragment class, the associated layout(XML) file, and connect the two
    -This can be done at any time in your project, and is the same procedure for all Fragments

04. Update the generated XML files for each Fragment(design your layout).
    -This is a good time to also make the XML layout file that will be used as
        a ViewHolder in the RecyclerView.  In this example, the view_holder_employee.xml
        layout is that view.
