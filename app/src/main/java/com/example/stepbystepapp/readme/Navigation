Navigation Component Steps
@author Marshall Ladd

01. Under 'res', add a folder named navigation.
    -The folder MUST be name 'navigation'
    -Right-click 'res'
    -new > android resource directory
    -change resource type to navigation
    -this should change the name of the folder to 'navigation'

02. Add a nav graph xml to the navigation folder
    -Right-click 'res > navigation'
    -new > navigation resource file
    -Mine is named nav_graph.xml

03. Add your fragments to the nav_graph.xml
    -Look for the icon that has a small green 'plus' symbol

04. Connect the fragments in the nav_graph in the order you want them to move.

05. Update the Activities layout to have a 'NavHostFragment'
    -Once added, a pop up screen will show, asking you which xml to link to this NavHostFragment.
        We only have the one option for now, so select that one.
    -Easiest to find 'NavHostFragment' in the design mode, in the palette
    -Search for 'NavHostFragment'
    -Ensure that it fills the entire screen

06. Wire up the Activity and the NavGraph
